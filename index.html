            <h2>Adding a Favicon</h2>
            <p>On this page, we're going to add a favicon. We need to begin with an image, convert it into the .ico file type, then link to it from the head of the HTML. Follow along as we practice!</p>
            <p>If you are having trouble seeing your favicon and are not working in Chrome, try switching to Chrome. Safari will often have issues with these.</p>
